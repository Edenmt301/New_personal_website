                <div class="center blog-title">Changes made in CSS3</div>
                <div class="center blog-content"><p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) is the visual language of the web, controlling everything visual about a website. 
                    The newest version of CSS is CSS3 which has added some major features that make it more powerful.Some of these 
                    features are discussed below.</p>
                <p>Flex box: CSS3 introduced flex box layout which made aligning a text or any other element vertically and on the 
                center much easier. This feature is added to adapt the layout of the page according to the different screen sizes 
                and devices. The items of a flex box stretch to fill additional space and shrinks in order to fit into smaller spaces</p>
                <p>It has less complicated and more classified modules: another benefit of CSS3 is that it was able to separate big 
                    modules into smaller modules which increase practicality. It has all the previous options but they are classified 
                    into smaller parts. Because of the classification of modules into smaller parts, problems that occur can be 
                    related to a separate module and they can be solved more easily. It took a lot of time to test a web design 
                    in the previous versions of CSS because finding the actual problem was very difficult.</p>
                <p>Responsive CSS grid layout: CSS3 is able to create a more flexible grid for different device sizes. The CSS3 
                    grid allows you to create both equal size and unequal size columns so designers can create any complicated 
                    layout. In addition it is a two dimensional system so it uses both row and column features which makes it very 
                    powerful.</p>
                <p>Backward compatibility and Faster: CSS3 is compatible with its previous version; the previous version can easily
                     be readjusted to CSS3. Using CSS3 is recommended because it is faster.</p>
                <p>Text animation: CSS3 has added a way that influences how users interact with the text element of a website. 
                    It has made hover adjustments, making words float around and many other animation features possible.</p>
                <p>3D transform: 3D modules that can be used in the website are made using this function. This is 2D transform function 
                    with the addition of the z-axis. We can spin, flip or even translate the color of elements on the page and add 
                    rotating pictures which looks very appealing to users.</p>
                <p>Media Queries: this option is used to adjust the website according to different sizes and devices, it is used to 
                    implement the mobile first mentality design. It is an easy functionality to use despite what most people assume 
                    about it. To use it we just have to enclose our CSS code inside a “@media rules” statement and the CSS inside the 
                    media query only executes if the rules are satisfied.</p>
                <p>Images and animations: in the previous version of CSS, JavaScript was needed to add and edit images and to add 
                    animations to the webpage. On CSS3 this problem was fixed and also other improvements were made. It supports of 
                    rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before. And CSS3 
                    Transitions are used to make changes in the display. With transitions; an element can seamlessly change size and 
                    color and duration for a transition can be set.</p>
                <p>Box sizing: on CSS3 box-sizing allows developers to set size for elements without subtracting padding and border 
                    unlike the previous versions the padding and border are included in the size of the element.</p>
